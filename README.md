# Odin Project Foundations - Exercise Recipes

Website created for the first exercise in the Foundations part of the Odin Project regarding basic proficency in HTML. The website consists of a homepage and a few linked pages with recipes presented in a defined format. 

I hope to use what is built here as a template for my own recipe store/book in the future.

## Things we are supposed to demonstrate
1. Basic commandline knowledge - create and navigate directories and files
2. Familiarity with basic git commands - add, commit, log, push and so on.
3. Github knowledge - create repo, push to it and use the built in web publishing capabilities.
4. Basic HTML - boilerplate, basic structure, tags for formatting text, lists etc., hyperlinks and embedding images.
