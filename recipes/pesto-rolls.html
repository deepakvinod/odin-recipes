        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3> DOUGH INGREDIENTS: </h3>
                <li> 1 cup milk </li>
                <li> 1/4 cup salted butter </li>
                <li> 2 tablespoons honey (or granulated sugar) </li>
                <li> 1 envelope (2 1/4 teaspoons) instant (“rapid rise”) yeast </li>
                <li> 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
                <li> 2 eggs </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon fine sea salt </li>
                <h3> PESTO FILLING INGREDIENTS: </h3>
                <li> 3/4 cup (6 ounces) basil pesto, plus extra for brushing on top </li>
                <li> 2 cups (8 ounces) shredded mozzarella cheese </li>
                <li> 1/2 cup freshly-grated Parmesan cheese </li>
                <li> fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> <em> Heat the milk mixture.</em> Combine milk, butter and honey in small saucepan. Heat over medium heat stirring frequently until the butter is melted and the mixture is 110°F. (It should feel warm but not hot to the touch — I recommend measuring the temperature with a cooking thermometer.) If the mixture is too hot, just wait a few minutes for it to cool. </li>
            <li> <em> Mix the dough.</em> In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough-hook attachment (or see notes below for how to knead the dough by hand), add the warm milk mixture. Sprinkle the yeast on top, then give the mixture a brief stir. Add 3 1/2 cups of flour, eggs and salt, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add more flour (up to an additional 1/2 cup), until the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. (Use no more than 4 cups of flour total.)  Continue beating for 5 minutes on low speed. Remove dough and form it into a ball with your hands. Place it in a greased bowl and cover with a damp towel. Let rest for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li> <em> Roll the dough (1st stage).</em>  Once the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 12 x 18 inches in size. Spread the pesto evenly over the top of the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on the left side (as shown in the photos above). Sprinkle the mozzarella and Parmesan evenly over the pesto, followed by a few extra twists of freshly-cracked black pepper and a pinch of sea salt. </li>
            <li> <em> Roll out the dough (2nd stage).</em> Beginning at the 18-inch edge, tightly roll up the dough and give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals. Use a piece of dental floss or a knife to slice off the top and bottom ends of the roll (just 1/2-inch or so on each end, which you can discard) so that the ends are even. Cut the remaining dough into 12 equal rounds. </li>
            <li> <em> Let the dough rise.</em> Place the rolls into a lightly-greased 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Cover the dish with a damp towel, and leave it in a warm place to rise for 25 minutes. Heat the oven to 350°F.
            <li> <em>Bake.</em> Once the rolls have risen, uncover the dish and place it on the center rack of the oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the rolls are very lightly golden on top and cooked through. Transfer the baking dish to a wire rack. Lightly brush the tops of the rolls with some extra pesto. </li>
            <li> <em>Serve.</em> Then serve the rolls while they’re nice and warm…and enjoy! </li>
